## Week 8 

Neville & Chun (Ephie, Shaya, & Oli)

### Task

The goal is to build an interactive game-like thing that uses data from an API.

---

### Setup

We had issues with creating our repo (nested folders)
We had a problem with not being able to push into main, only master. This was our error message:

```
error: src refspec main does not match any
error: failed to push some refs to 'github.com:fac21/week_8_cn.git'
```

### Ideas

-Basketball API
ProsV Cons:

- IMDB Movies site
Pros V Cons:

- Studio Ghibli API
Pros V Cons:


(Ultimately) Selected Ghibli:
Comparing films, options to compare:
- Rotten Tomato score (highest wins)
- Running time (longest wins)
- Year (newest wins)


---

### Criteria

- Accept some user input (e.g. a username)
- Query an API (e.g. the Github API, or any other fun one)
- Populate the UI with API data
- Have some form of persistent state and interactivity, e.g.
  A hunger bar that decreases over time and is topped up when you feed them stars
  A button to add more users to your collection

Stretch criteria
- Save your state to localstorage so you can leave the page and come back later
- Make it look great

### Issues

- Nested folders
- Nested Fetch in API
- Submitting a Form
- Deployed site not updating when pushes made to GitHub
- Image not showing
